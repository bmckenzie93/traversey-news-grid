I am about to start this project. My intensions are to learn more about using css grid and commiting it to muscle memory. I am almost done with this course, afterwords I will make a portfolio piece using all of the knowledge I have learned thus far.

I completed the nav bar and showcase, and started on the articles. So far I learned from the example of using grid for the nav bar, I ususally use flexbox for that. I was also reminded that when using the :before psudo selector to overlay a transparent image on a dark background to use position relative/absolute, include content " ", and use top:0 left:0 width: 100% height: 100%.
